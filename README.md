# PostgreSpin – Automated PostgreSQL Setup & Validation
## Description:
PostgreSpin is a lightweight infra automation project that installs, configures, and validates a PostgreSQL service using Bash and Bats. It provisions PostgreSQL, creates a test user and database, and runs automated tests to ensure the service is active and accepting connections — all in one command via `make setup` and `make test.`
